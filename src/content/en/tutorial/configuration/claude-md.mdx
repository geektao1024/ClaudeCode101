# CLAUDE.md Setup

CLAUDE.md is a special file that provides persistent context about your project to Claude Code across sessions. It serves as a project knowledge base and configuration guide.

## What is CLAUDE.md?

CLAUDE.md is a markdown file that contains:
- **Project Overview**: Architecture, tech stack, and key concepts
- **Development Commands**: Common tasks and build processes
- **File Structure**: Important directories and their purposes
- **Coding Standards**: Style guides and conventions
- **Known Issues**: Current limitations and workarounds

## Creating CLAUDE.md

### Basic Structure

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description of what this project does and its main purpose.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Docker + AWS ECS

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── pages/          # Route components
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
├── utils/          # Helper functions
├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
├── api/            # API client and types
└── assets/         # Static assets
```

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Write unit tests for all utilities
- Use semantic commit messages

## Important Notes

- Database migrations in /migrations
- Environment variables in .env.local
- API documentation at /docs/api.md
- Design system components in /src/components/ui
```

### Advanced CLAUDE.md

```markdown
# Advanced Project Setup

## Current Sprint Goals

- [ ] Implement user authentication system
- [ ] Add payment processing integration
- [ ] Optimize database queries for dashboard
- [ ] Complete mobile responsive design

## Key Business Logic

### User Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via /login
2. Server validates against bcrypt hash
3. JWT token issued with 24h expiration
4. Client stores token in httpOnly cookie
5. Protected routes verify token via middleware

### Payment Processing
- Stripe integration for card payments
- Webhook handling for payment status updates
- Refund processing through admin panel
- Monthly subscription billing cycle

## Database Schema Notes

### Users Table
- id: UUID primary key
- email: unique, indexed
- password_hash: bcrypt with 12 rounds
- created_at, updated_at: timestamps
- stripe_customer_id: for payment integration

### Known Issues & Workarounds

1. **Slow Dashboard Loading**
   - Issue: Complex joins in analytics query
   - Workaround: Added Redis caching layer
   - TODO: Implement database views

2. **Mobile Safari Scroll Bug**
   - Issue: Smooth scrolling breaks on iOS
   - Workaround: Disabled smooth scroll for mobile
   - TODO: Find CSS-only solution

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here
```

### Local Development Setup
1. Install PostgreSQL and Redis
2. Copy .env.example to .env.local
3. Run `npm run db:migrate`
4. Run `npm run db:seed` for test data
5. Start with `npm run dev`

## External Dependencies

### Critical Services
- Stripe for payments (backup: PayPal)
- SendGrid for emails (backup: AWS SES)
- Cloudinary for image storage
- Redis for caching

### API Integrations
- GitHub API for repository data
- Slack API for notifications
- Google Analytics for metrics

## Deployment Notes

### Staging Environment
- URL: https://staging.myapp.com
- Auto-deploys from 'develop' branch
- Uses staging Stripe keys
- Database: staging.postgres.myapp.com

### Production Environment
- URL: https://myapp.com
- Manual deploys from 'main' branch
- Requires approval for schema changes
- Monitor: DataDog dashboard

## Team Conventions

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches: feature/description
- Commit format: type(scope): description
- Squash merge to main
- Delete branches after merge

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass and coverage maintained
- [ ] TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Performance impact considered
- [ ] Security review completed

## Quick Reference

### Important File Locations
- Main config: src/config/app.ts
- API routes: src/pages/api/
- Database models: src/models/
- Shared types: src/types/index.ts
- Utils: src/utils/
```

## Placement and Organization

### File Location Options

**Project Root** (Recommended)
```
/CLAUDE.md
```

**Documentation Folder**
```
/docs/CLAUDE.md
```

**Multiple CLAUDE.md Files**
```
/CLAUDE.md                 # Main project overview
/backend/CLAUDE.md         # Backend-specific info
/frontend/CLAUDE.md        # Frontend-specific info
/deployment/CLAUDE.md      # Deployment procedures
```

### Integration with Git

**Include in Repository**
```bash
# Add to git
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "docs: add project context for Claude Code"
```

**Keep Updated**
```bash
# Regular updates
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "docs: update project status and current sprint goals"
```

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

**Be Specific**
- Include exact commands, not general descriptions
- Provide file paths and line numbers when relevant
- List specific versions of dependencies

**Keep Current**
- Update after major changes
- Remove outdated information
- Reflect current project state

**Include Context**
- Explain why decisions were made
- Document known limitations
- Provide business context

### Maintenance

**Regular Reviews**
- Weekly updates during active development
- Monthly reviews for stable projects
- Update after architectural changes

**Team Collaboration**
- Include team-specific conventions
- Document shared knowledge
- Update after onboarding new members

## Examples by Project Type

### React Application
Focus on: Components, hooks, state management, routing, testing patterns

### Node.js API
Focus on: Routes, middleware, database schema, authentication, error handling

### Full-Stack Application
Focus on: Both frontend and backend concerns, deployment, environment management

### Library/Package
Focus on: API documentation, usage examples, contribution guidelines, testing
