# Direction Correction

Learn how to effectively redirect Claude Code when it misunderstands your requirements or goes off-track during development tasks.

## Recognizing When Course Correction is Needed

### Common Signs
- Claude is working on wrong files or components
- Implementation doesn't match your requirements
- Solution is overly complex for the problem
- Claude is making assumptions about project structure
- Output doesn't align with existing code patterns

### Early Detection
Monitor these indicators:
- First few lines of code changes
- File selections and modifications
- Approach explanations
- Question patterns from Claude

## Course Correction Techniques

### 1. Immediate Redirection

**Stop and Clarify**
```
Stop. Before continuing, let me clarify the requirements.
I need you to focus specifically on [specific aspect].
The current approach is not what I'm looking for.
```

**Redirect Focus**
```
Actually, let's take a different approach. 
Instead of modifying the entire component, 
I only need you to [specific limited task].
```

### 2. Context Reset

**Provide Fresh Context**
```
Let me restart with clearer context:
- Current file: src/components/UserProfile.tsx
- Specific issue: The username validation on line 45
- Required change: Only update the regex pattern
- Don't modify: Any other validation logic
```

**Clarify Scope**
```
This task should only involve:
1. [Specific action 1]
2. [Specific action 2]
3. [Specific action 3]

Do not:
- Refactor existing code
- Add new dependencies
- Modify other components
```

### 3. Constraint Setting

**Technical Constraints**
```
Important constraints for this task:
- Use only existing dependencies
- Maintain current API interface
- Follow existing error handling patterns
- No breaking changes to public methods
```

**Scope Constraints**
```
Limit changes to:
- Only the calculateTotal function
- Only the validation logic
- Only the CSS styling for mobile view
```

## Effective Correction Patterns

### The "Actually" Pattern
```
Actually, that's not quite what I need.
Let me be more specific: [clear instruction]
```

### The "Instead" Pattern
```
Instead of creating a new component,
please modify the existing LoginForm component
to include the password strength indicator.
```

### The "Focus" Pattern
```
Let's focus specifically on the error handling.
Ignore the UI changes for now and just fix
the async/await pattern in the API call.
```

### The "Step Back" Pattern
```
Let's step back. The core issue is [simple problem].
We don't need to restructure anything,
just [minimal change needed].
```

## Advanced Correction Strategies

### 1. Incremental Correction

**Approach**
- Correct one aspect at a time
- Validate each correction before proceeding
- Build up to complete solution

**Example**
```
First, let's just get the basic function working.
Don't worry about error handling or optimization yet.
Once we have the core logic right, we'll add those features.
```

### 2. Reference-Based Correction

**Use Existing Examples**
```
Look at how we handle authentication in src/auth/login.ts.
Use that same pattern for the logout functionality.
Don't create a new pattern.
```

**Point to Specific Code**
```
See the error handling in UserService.ts lines 23-35?
Apply that exact same pattern to the ProductService,
but change the error messages appropriately.
```

### 3. Assumption Challenging

**Question Assumptions**
```
Why are you creating a new configuration file?
The existing config in settings.json should handle this.
Please use the existing configuration structure.
```

**Clarify Misunderstandings**
```
I think there's a misunderstanding.
I don't want to replace the entire navigation system.
I just want to add one menu item to the existing nav.
```

## Preventing Off-Track Situations

### 1. Clear Initial Instructions

**Be Specific from the Start**
```
Please update ONLY the password validation regex
in src/utils/validation.ts line 42.
Change from /^.{6,}$/ to /^(?=.*[A-Za-z])(?=.*\d)[A-Za-z\d]{8,}$/
Do not modify any other validation functions.
```

### 2. Provide Examples

**Show Expected Outcome**
```
The result should look like this:
[provide code example or description]

Not like this:
[provide counter-example]
```

### 3. Set Boundaries

**Define What NOT to Do**
```
For this task, please do not:
- Modify the database schema
- Change the API endpoints
- Update any test files
- Install new packages
```

## Recovery Strategies

### When Claude Has Gone Too Far Off-Track

**1. Full Reset**
```
Let's start over completely.
Please ignore everything we've discussed so far.
Here's what I actually need: [fresh, clear instruction]
```

**2. Partial Recovery**
```
The first part of your approach is correct.
However, for step 2, instead of [incorrect approach],
please [correct approach].
```

**3. Selective Acceptance**
```
Keep the changes to the component structure,
but revert the styling changes.
I'll provide specific CSS requirements separately.
```

## Common Correction Scenarios

### 1. Over-Engineering
**Problem**: Claude creates complex solution for simple problem
**Solution**: 
```
This is much more complex than needed.
I just need a simple [specific requirement].
Can you provide a minimal solution?
```

### 2. Wrong File Focus
**Problem**: Claude modifies wrong files
**Solution**:
```
Stop working on those files.
The issue is specifically in [correct file].
Please focus only on that file.
```

### 3. Scope Creep
**Problem**: Claude keeps adding related improvements
**Solution**:
```
Please limit the changes to exactly what I requested.
Don't add any additional improvements or optimizations.
```

### 4. Pattern Deviation
**Problem**: Claude uses different patterns than existing code
**Solution**:
```
Use the same pattern as [existing example].
Don't create a new approach.
Consistency with existing code is important.
```

## Best Practices for Direction Correction

### Do
- Interrupt early when you notice issues
- Be specific about what's wrong
- Provide clear alternative direction
- Reference existing code patterns
- Set explicit boundaries

### Don't
- Let Claude continue on wrong path
- Use vague correction language
- Assume Claude will infer the right direction
- Skip providing positive examples
- Ignore early warning signs
