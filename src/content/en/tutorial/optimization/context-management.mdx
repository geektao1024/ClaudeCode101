# Context Management

Learn how to manage context effectively to maintain productive, focused conversations with Claude Code throughout your development session.

## Understanding Context Limits

Claude Code has context limitations that affect long conversations:
- Token limits for each conversation
- Memory constraints for complex codebases
- Performance impacts with excessive context

## Context Management Strategies

### 1. Session Planning

**Break Large Tasks into Sessions**
- Plan major features across multiple focused sessions
- Complete related subtasks in single sessions
- Use clear session boundaries

### 2. Context Reset Techniques

**When to Reset**
- After completing major milestones
- When conversation becomes unfocused
- Before starting unrelated tasks
- When hitting context limits

**How to Reset Effectively**
```bash
# Start fresh session with summary
claude --resume "Completed user authentication. Now implementing dashboard features."
```

### 3. Information Prioritization

**Keep Context Relevant**
- Focus on current task files
- Remove outdated discussion threads
- Prioritize active code sections
- Archive completed work references

## Effective Context Patterns

### The CLAUDE.md Approach

Create a persistent context file:

```markdown
# Project Context

## Current Sprint
- [ ] User dashboard implementation
- [ ] API integration for analytics
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness fixes

## Key Files
- `src/components/Dashboard/` - Main dashboard components
- `src/api/analytics.ts` - Analytics API client
- `src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts` - Analytics data hook

## Important Decisions
- Using React Query for data fetching
- Material-UI for component library
- TypeScript strict mode enabled

## Known Issues
- Dashboard loading performance (tracking in issue #123)
- Mobile menu overflow on small screens
```

### Progressive Context Building

**Start Broad, Then Focus**
1. Begin with high-level overview
2. Narrow to specific modules
3. Focus on immediate task
4. Expand context as needed

### Context Handoffs

**Between Sessions**
```
Previous session completed user authentication with JWT tokens. 
Next: Implement protected routes and user profile management.
Key files: src/auth/, src/components/Profile/
Current branch: feature/user-profiles
```

## Context Organization Techniques

### 1. Layered Context

**Layer 1: Project Level**
- Overall architecture
- Tech stack decisions
- Coding standards

**Layer 2: Feature Level**
- Feature requirements
- Related components
- API endpoints

**Layer 3: Task Level**
- Specific implementation details
- Current file content
- Immediate next steps

### 2. Context Anchoring

**Use Reference Points**
- Specific file paths
- Function/class names
- Configuration sections
- Previous decisions

**Example Anchors**
```
Based on the UserService pattern in src/services/user.ts, 
implement ProjectService with similar error handling.
```

### 3. Context Compression

**Summarize When Needed**
- Compress long discussions into key points
- Extract decision rationale
- Archive implementation details
- Keep only active context

## Tools for Context Management

### 1. CLAUDE.md File

```markdown
# Context Tracker

## Session Goals
- [ ] Fix mobile responsive issues
- [ ] Add user preference settings
- [ ] Update documentation

## Active Files
- src/components/MobileNav.tsx
- src/contexts/UserPreferences.tsx
- docs/user-guide.md

## Decisions Made
- Using localStorage for user preferences
- Implementing responsive breakpoints at 768px, 1024px
- Adding dark mode toggle to settings panel
```

### 2. Session Bookmarks

```markdown
## Quick References
- Main component: `src/components/Dashboard/index.tsx:45`
- API endpoint: `src/api/routes.ts:127`
- Type definitions: `src/types/user.ts:12`
- Test file: `__tests__/Dashboard.test.tsx`
```

### 3. Context Validation

**Regular Check-ins**
- Confirm understanding of current goals
- Verify file locations and content
- Validate assumptions about project state
- Update context as project evolves

## Best Practices

### Do
- Start each session with clear context
- Update CLAUDE.md regularly
- Use specific file references
- Summarize complex discussions
- Archive completed work

### Don't
- Let context drift without correction
- Include irrelevant historical details
- Assume Claude remembers previous sessions
- Overload with unnecessary technical details
- Skip context setup for "quick" tasks

## Troubleshooting Context Issues

### When Claude Seems Confused
1. **Reset and refocus**: Clearly state current objective
2. **Provide fresh context**: Share relevant file contents
3. **Confirm assumptions**: Verify project state understanding
4. **Simplify scope**: Break down complex requests

### When Hitting Context Limits
1. **Summarize progress**: Extract key decisions and next steps
2. **Start new session**: Use --resume with summary
3. **Prioritize content**: Focus on immediately relevant information
4. **Archive details**: Move completed work to documentation
