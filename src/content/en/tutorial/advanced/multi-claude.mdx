# Multi-Claude Collaboration

Beyond standalone use, some of the most powerful applications involve running multiple Claude instances in parallel for efficient collaborative development.

## Collaboration Modes

### 1. Coding and Validation Separation

Have one Claude write code while another reviews or tests:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Write code
claude
> Please implement user authentication functionality

# Terminal 2: Code review  
claude
> Please review the user authentication code just implemented, focusing on security
```

**Workflow**:
1. Claude A writes code
2. Run `/clear` or start new Claude instance
3. Claude B reviews Claude A's work
4. Claude C edits code based on feedback

### 2. Test-Driven Collaboration

```bash
# Claude 1: Write tests
claude
> Write comprehensive test cases for user login functionality

# Claude 2: Implement features
claude  
> Implement login functionality based on these test cases, ensure all tests pass
```

## Multi-Checkout Strategy

### Git Multi-Checkout

Create independent workspaces for different tasks:

```bash
# Create multiple checkouts
git clone <repo> project-auth
git clone <repo> project-ui  
git clone <repo> project-api

# Start Claude in each directory
cd project-auth && claude &
cd project-ui && claude &
cd project-api && claude &
```

### Git Worktrees

Lightweight multi-branch management:

```bash
# Create worktrees
git worktree add ../project-feature-a feature-a
git worktree add ../project-feature-b feature-b

# Start Claude in each worktree
cd ../project-feature-a && claude &
cd ../project-feature-b && claude &
```

**Worktree Advantages**:
- Shared Git history and reflog
- Independent working directories and files
- Lightweight, no need for repeated cloning

## Collaboration Best Practices

### 1. Task Division

```bash
# Claude 1: Focus on backend API
claude
> Specialize in implementing RESTful API and database operations

# Claude 2: Focus on frontend UI
claude
> Specialize in React components and user interaction logic

# Claude 3: Focus on testing
claude  
> Specialize in writing and maintaining test cases
```

### 2. Shared Workboard

Let Claude instances communicate through documentation:

```bash
# Create shared workboard
echo "# Project Collaboration Board" > COLLABORATION.md

# Claude 1 writes tasks
claude
> Record completed API interfaces in COLLABORATION.md

# Claude 2 reads and responds
claude
> Check COLLABORATION.md, implement frontend calls based on API interfaces
```

### 3. Version Control Coordination

```bash
# Regular sync
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Avoid conflicts
git status
git diff
```

## Advanced Collaboration Modes

### Fan-out Mode

Suitable for large-scale migrations or analysis:

```python
# Generate task script
tasks = generate_migration_tasks()

for task in tasks:
    subprocess.run([
        "claude", "-p", f"Migrate file {task.file}",
        "--allowedTools", "Edit,Bash(git commit:*)"
    ])
```

### Pipeline Mode

Integrate Claude into data processing pipelines:

```bash
# Data processing pipeline
cat data.json | claude -p "Analyze data quality" --json | process_results.py
```

## Environment Setup

### iTerm2 Notifications

Set up notification reminders on Mac:

```bash
# ~/.zshrc
export CLAUDE_NOTIFY=true

# Notify when task completes
claude && osascript -e 'display notification "Claude task completed"'
```

### Terminal Management

```bash
# Use tmux to manage multiple sessions
tmux new-session -d -s claude-auth
tmux new-session -d -s claude-ui
tmux new-session -d -s claude-test

# Switch sessions
tmux attach -t claude-auth
```

## Cleanup and Maintenance

### Worktree Cleanup

```bash
# View worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove completed worktrees
git worktree remove ../project-feature-a
git branch -d feature-a
```

### Process Management

```bash
# View running Claude processes
ps aux | grep claude

# Batch stop
pkill -f "claude"
```

## Team Collaboration

### Shared Configuration

```bash
# Team-shared CLAUDE.md
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "Update team Claude configuration"
```

### Collaboration Standards

1. **Naming Convention**: Use consistent branch and worktree naming for different tasks
2. **Communication Protocol**: Define when human intervention and decisions are needed
3. **Merge Strategy**: Determine when to merge independently developed features
