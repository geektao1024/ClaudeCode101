# Headless Mode Automation

Claude Code includes headless mode for non-interactive contexts like CI, pre-commit hooks, build scripts, and automation.

## What is Headless Mode

Headless mode allows you to use Claude Code programmatically without an interactive interface. Use the `-p` flag with a prompt to enable headless mode.

## Basic Usage

```bash
claude -p "Analyze current project code quality and generate a report"
```

## Common Parameters

- `--output-format stream-json` - Streaming JSON output
- `--allowedTools` - Specify allowed tools
- `--verbose` - Verbose output for debugging

## Use Cases

### 1. Issue Triage

Headless mode can support automation triggered by GitHub events:

```bash
claude -p "Analyze this GitHub Issue and add appropriate labels" \
  --allowedTools "Read,Bash(gh:*)"
```

### 2. Code Review

Subjective code review beyond traditional tool detection:

```bash
claude -p "Check code for typos, outdated comments, and misleading function names" \
  --allowedTools "Read,Write"
```

### 3. Batch Processing

Handle large migrations or analysis tasks:

```bash
# Generate task list
claude -p "Generate list of files needing React to Vue migration"

# Process in loop
for file in $(cat migration-list.txt); do
  claude -p "Migrate $file from React to Vue" \
    --allowedTools "Edit,Bash(git commit:*)"
done
```

## Important Notes

- Headless mode doesn't persist between sessions - must restart each time
- Use `--verbose` for debugging, disable in production
- Ensure stable network connection
