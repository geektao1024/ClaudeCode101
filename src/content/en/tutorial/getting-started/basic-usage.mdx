# Basic Usage

After installing Claude Code, learn the essential usage patterns that will make you productive with this AI-powered development assistant.

## Starting a Conversation

### Simple Commands

Claude Code works best with clear, specific instructions:

```
Create a React component for a user profile card
```

```
Fix the TypeScript errors in the authentication module
```

```
Add unit tests for the shopping cart functionality
```

### Natural Language

You can interact with Claude using natural language:

```
I'm getting a 404 error when trying to access the /api/users endpoint. 
Can you help me debug this issue?
```

```
The mobile navigation menu isn't working properly on small screens. 
Please help me make it responsive.
```

## Essential Workflows

### 1. Explore-Plan-Code

This is the most versatile Claude Code pattern:

**Step 1: Explore**
```
Help me understand the current authentication system in this codebase
```

**Step 2: Plan**
```
I need to add OAuth login support. What's the best approach for this project?
```

**Step 3: Code**
```
Implement Google OAuth integration using the plan we discussed
```

### 2. File Operations

**Reading Files**
```
Show me the content of src/components/Header.tsx
```

**Editing Code**
```
Update the Header component to include a dark mode toggle
```

**Creating Files**
```
Create a new utility function for formatting dates in src/utils/date.ts
```

### 3. Testing and Quality

**Running Tests**
```
Run the test suite and fix any failing tests
```

**Code Quality**
```
Review this component for potential improvements and best practices
```

**Error Fixing**
```
Fix the build errors and make sure the project compiles successfully
```

## Working with Projects

### Project Context

Claude automatically understands your project structure:

```
Add a new API endpoint for user preferences following the existing patterns
```

```
Create a component that matches the design system used in other components
```

### Code Style Consistency

Claude maintains consistency with your existing code:

```
Refactor this function to match the coding style used in the rest of the project
```

```
Add TypeScript types following the patterns in the existing codebase
```

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### 1. Multi-Step Tasks

Break complex tasks into manageable steps:

```
I need to implement a complete user authentication system. 
Let's start by planning the architecture and then implement it step by step.
```

### 2. Context Building

Provide relevant context for better results:

```
I'm working on an e-commerce app using React and Node.js. 
The payment system uses Stripe. I need to add subscription billing.
Here's the current payment code: [paste code]
```

### 3. Iterative Development

Build features incrementally:

```
Create a basic user dashboard with just the profile section first.
We'll add analytics and settings in the next iteration.
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific

**Good**: "Fix the memory leak in the useEffect hook in UserProfile.tsx"
**Better**: "The useEffect in UserProfile.tsx on line 15 is causing a memory leak because it's not cleaning up the event listener"

### 2. Provide Context

**Good**: "Add error handling"
**Better**: "Add error handling to the API calls in the user service, following the pattern used in the auth service"

### 3. Use Examples

**Good**: "Style this button"
**Better**: "Style this button to match the primary buttons in the design system, like the one in LoginForm.tsx"

### 4. Reference Existing Code

```
Create a new component similar to UserCard but for displaying product information
```

```
Use the same validation pattern as in the registration form
```

## Common Commands

### Development
- `Start the development server`
- `Build the project for production`
- `Run the linting checks`
- `Update the dependencies`

### Debugging
- `Help me debug this error: [error message]`
- `Check why the tests are failing`
- `Investigate the performance issue in [component]`

### Code Quality
- `Review this code for security issues`
- `Optimize this function for better performance`
- `Add proper error handling to this API call`

### Documentation
- `Add JSDoc comments to this function`
- `Update the README with the new features`
- `Create API documentation for these endpoints`

## Getting Help

### Ask for Explanations
```
Explain how this authentication middleware works
```

### Request Best Practices
```
What's the best way to handle state management in this React app?
```

### Troubleshooting
```
The build is failing with this error: [error]. How do I fix it?
```
