# Bash Tools

Claude Code provides powerful integration with command-line tools through the Bash tool, allowing you to execute shell commands and work with various CLI utilities.

## Basic Bash Tool Usage

### Simple Commands

Claude can execute basic shell commands:

```
Run `ls -la` to see all files in the current directory
```

Claude executes:
```bash
ls -la
```

### Complex Commands

```
Check git status and show recent commits
```

Claude executes:
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

## Common Development Workflows

### 1. Package Management

**npm/yarn/pnpm Operations**
```
Install new dependencies and update package.json
```

Claude executes:
```bash
npm install lodash @types/lodash
npm update
```

**Version Management**
```
Check current Node.js and npm versions
```

Claude executes:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

### 2. Git Operations

**Repository Status**
```
Show current branch, status, and recent changes
```

Claude executes:
```bash
git branch
git status
git diff --stat
```

**Branch Management**
```
Create a new feature branch and switch to it
```

Claude executes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-dashboard
git push -u origin feature/new-dashboard
```

### 3. Build and Test Commands

**Running Tests**
```
Run unit tests and generate coverage report
```

Claude executes:
```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

**Build Operations**
```
Build the project and check for errors
```

Claude executes:
```bash
npm run build
npm run type-check
```

## Advanced Bash Integration

### 1. Piped Commands

```
Find all TypeScript files and search for specific function
```

Claude executes:
```bash
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | xargs grep -l "useEffect"
```

### 2. Environment Management

```
Set environment variables and run development server
```

Claude executes:
```bash
export NODE_ENV=development
export DEBUG=true
npm run dev
```

### 3. File Operations

```
Create directory structure and initialize files
```

Claude executes:
```bash
mkdir -p src/components/Dashboard/{components,hooks,utils}
touch src/components/Dashboard/index.ts
touch src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx
```

## Tool Integration Examples

### Docker Operations
```
Build and run Docker container for the application
```

Claude executes:
```bash
docker build -t my-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

### Database Management
```
Run database migrations and seed data
```

Claude executes:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma db seed
```

### Linting and Formatting
```
Fix code formatting and linting issues
```

Claude executes:
```bash
npm run lint -- --fix
npm run format
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Command Validation

Claude validates commands before execution:
- Checks for potentially dangerous operations
- Confirms file paths exist
- Validates command syntax

### 2. Error Handling

When commands fail, Claude:
- Analyzes error output
- Suggests alternative approaches
- Provides troubleshooting steps

### 3. Path Management

**Absolute vs Relative Paths**
```bash
# Claude prefers absolute paths when possible
cd /full/path/to/project
npm install

# Rather than relative navigation
cd ../../../project && npm install
```

## Security Considerations

### Allowed Operations
- File system navigation and inspection
- Package management operations
- Git repository management
- Build and test commands
- Development server operations

### Restricted Operations
- System-level modifications
- User account management
- Network configuration changes
- Destructive operations without confirmation

## Configuration Options

### Tool Permissions

Configure allowed Bash commands in your Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "allowedTools": [
    "Bash(npm:*)",
    "Bash(git:*)",
    "Bash(docker:*)",
    "Bash(ls:*)",
    "Bash(cd:*)"
  ]
}
```

### Command Timeouts

Set timeout limits for long-running commands:

```json
{
  "bashTimeout": 300000,
  "buildTimeout": 600000
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command Not Found**
- Verify tool is installed
- Check PATH environment variable
- Use absolute path to executable

**Permission Denied**
- Check file permissions
- Verify write access to directory
- Consider using sudo (if allowed)

**Command Timeouts**
- Increase timeout settings
- Break down into smaller commands
- Use background processes for long operations
