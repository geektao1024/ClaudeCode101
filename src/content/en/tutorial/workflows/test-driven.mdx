# Test-Driven Development

Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflows with Claude Code to build robust, well-tested applications with confidence.

## TDD Fundamentals

### The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

Claude Code enhances the traditional TDD cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### Getting Started with TDD

```
I want to implement a user authentication system using TDD. 
Let's start by writing tests for the login functionality.
```

Claude will:
- Help design comprehensive test cases
- Suggest edge cases to consider
- Create test structure following best practices
- Guide implementation step by step

## TDD Workflow with Claude

### 1. Test Planning

**Define Requirements**:
```
I need to implement a shopping cart feature. Help me plan the tests:
1. What functionality should be tested?
2. What edge cases should I consider?
3. How should I structure the test suite?
```

**Test Case Design**:
```
Create comprehensive test cases for a user registration system that includes:
- Email validation
- Password strength requirements
- Duplicate email handling
- Database integration
```

### 2. Writing Tests First

**Unit Tests**:
```
Write unit tests for a calculateTotal function that:
- Adds item prices
- Applies discounts
- Handles tax calculation
- Manages currency formatting
```

**Integration Tests**:
```
Create integration tests for the user authentication API that test:
- Login endpoint
- Token generation
- Session management
- Error handling
```

### 3. Implementation Guidance

**Minimal Implementation**:
```
I have these failing tests for a user service. 
Help me write the minimal code to make them pass:
[paste test code]
```

**Iterative Development**:
```
My tests are passing but the code needs refactoring. 
Help me improve it while keeping all tests green.
```

## Advanced TDD Patterns

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

```
Convert these user stories into BDD-style tests:
- As a user, I want to add items to my cart
- As a user, I want to remove items from my cart
- As a user, I want to see my cart total
```

### Test Doubles and Mocking

```
Create mocks for external dependencies in my payment processing tests:
1. Payment gateway API
2. Database connections
3. Email service
4. Logging system
```

### Property-Based Testing

```
Implement property-based tests for my string utility functions:
1. Test with random inputs
2. Verify invariants hold
3. Find edge cases automatically
```

## Testing Strategies

### Frontend TDD

**Component Testing**:
```
Write tests for a React component that:
1. Renders correctly with props
2. Handles user interactions
3. Manages internal state
4. Integrates with external APIs
```

**E2E Testing**:
```
Create end-to-end tests for the user registration flow:
1. Navigate to registration page
2. Fill out form with valid data
3. Submit and verify success
4. Test error scenarios
```

### Backend TDD

**API Testing**:
```
Write comprehensive API tests for a REST endpoint:
1. Valid request/response cycles
2. Authentication and authorization
3. Input validation
4. Error handling
```

**Database Testing**:
```
Create database tests that:
1. Test CRUD operations
2. Verify data integrity
3. Check constraint enforcement
4. Test transaction handling
```

## Test Organization

### Test Structure

```
Organize my test suite for a large application:
1. Unit tests by module
2. Integration tests by feature
3. E2E tests by user journey
4. Performance tests by scenario
```

### Test Data Management

```
Set up test data management:
1. Create test fixtures
2. Implement data factories
3. Manage test database state
4. Handle test isolation
```

### Continuous Testing

```
Set up continuous testing pipeline:
1. Run tests on every commit
2. Parallel test execution
3. Test result reporting
4. Failure notifications
```

## Common TDD Challenges

### Legacy Code Testing

```
I have legacy code without tests. Help me:
1. Add characterization tests
2. Refactor safely
3. Improve testability
4. Gradually increase coverage
```

### Testing Complex Logic

```
Write tests for complex business logic:
1. Break down into smaller units
2. Test each component separately
3. Verify integration points
4. Handle edge cases
```

### Performance Testing

```
Create performance tests that:
1. Measure response times
2. Test under load
3. Identify bottlenecks
4. Verify scalability
```

## Best Practices

### Test Quality

- **Clear Test Names**: Describe what is being tested
- **Single Responsibility**: One assertion per test
- **Independent Tests**: No dependencies between tests
- **Fast Execution**: Keep tests quick to run

### Code Coverage

```
Analyze test coverage and identify:
1. Untested code paths
2. Missing edge cases
3. Integration gaps
4. Critical areas needing more tests
```

### Test Maintenance

```
Refactor tests to:
1. Reduce duplication
2. Improve readability
3. Update for code changes
4. Remove obsolete tests
```

## Tools and Frameworks

## Measuring Success

### Metrics to Track

```
Track TDD effectiveness:
1. Test coverage percentage
2. Bug detection rate
3. Development velocity
4. Code quality metrics
```

### Continuous Improvement

```
Regularly review and improve:
1. Test suite performance
2. Test reliability
3. Development workflow
4. Team practices
```

By following TDD practices with Claude Code, you'll build more reliable software, catch bugs early, and maintain confidence in your codebase as it evolves.
