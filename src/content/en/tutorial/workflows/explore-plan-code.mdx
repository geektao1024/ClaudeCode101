# Explore-Plan-Code Workflow

This is one of the most successful workflow patterns in the Claude Code user community, suitable for most programming tasks.

## Workflow Overview

The Explore-Plan-Code workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Explore Phase** - Understand the problem and existing code
2. **Plan Phase** - Develop a detailed solution strategy  
3. **Code Phase** - Implement the solution
4. **Commit Phase** - Complete code commits and documentation updates

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Explore Phase

**Goal**: Thoroughly understand the problem context and existing code structure

**Action Guide**:

```
Please read the following files and understand the project structure, 
but don't write any code yet:
- src/components/UserList.tsx
- src/services/userService.ts
- docs/api.md

I need to add user search functionality. Please first understand 
the existing user management logic.
```

**Best Practices**:

- ✅ Explicitly tell Claude **don't write code yet**
- ✅ Provide specific file paths or general guidance
- ✅ Explain the specific problem you want to solve

**Example Conversation**:

```
User: Please read all files in the src/auth/ directory and understand 
the current authentication system implementation. Don't modify any code. 
I want to add two-factor authentication functionality.

Claude: I'll analyze your authentication system...
[Claude reads and analyzes files]

I've analyzed your authentication system and found these key components:

1. AuthService (src/auth/AuthService.ts) - Handles login/logout
2. JWT middleware (src/auth/middleware.ts) - Token validation
3. User model (src/auth/User.ts) - User data structure
4. Login component (src/auth/LoginForm.tsx) - UI interface

Current architecture uses JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration. 
For 2FA integration, I recommend...
```

### Step 2: Plan Phase

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive implementation plan

**Action Guide**:

```
Based on your analysis of the auth system, please create a detailed plan 
for implementing 2FA. Include:
- Required code changes
- New dependencies needed
- Database schema updates
- Testing strategy
```

**Best Practices**:

- ✅ Ask for specific plan components
- ✅ Request consideration of edge cases
- ✅ Include testing and validation steps

**Example Planning Output**:

```
## 2FA Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Changes
1. Install `speakeasy` library for TOTP generation
2. Add 2FA fields to User model:
   - `twoFactorSecret` (encrypted)
   - `twoFactorEnabled` (boolean)
3. Create new API endpoints:
   - POST /auth/2fa/setup - Generate QR code
   - POST /auth/2fa/verify - Verify TOTP code
   - POST /auth/2fa/disable - Disable 2FA

### Phase 2: Frontend Changes
1. Add 2FA setup component with QR code display
2. Modify login flow to include TOTP verification
3. Add 2FA management to user settings

### Phase 3: Testing
1. Unit tests for TOTP generation/validation
2. Integration tests for auth flow
3. E2E tests for complete user journey
```

### Step 3: Code Phase

**Goal**: Implement the planned solution step by step

**Action Guide**:

```
Let's implement the 2FA feature following the plan. 
Start with Phase 1 - the backend changes. 
Implement each file one at a time.
```

**Best Practices**:

- ✅ Implement incrementally
- ✅ Test each component before moving on
- ✅ Follow the established plan but adapt as needed

**Incremental Implementation**:

```
1. First: Install dependencies and update User model
2. Then: Create 2FA service with TOTP functions
3. Next: Add API endpoints
4. Then: Update authentication middleware
5. Finally: Create frontend components
```

### Step 4: Commit Phase

**Goal**: Complete the implementation with proper commits and documentation

**Action Guide**:

```
Now let's finalize the 2FA implementation:
1. Run all tests and fix any issues
2. Update documentation
3. Create a git commit with proper message
```

**Commit Best Practices**:

- ✅ Test everything before committing
- ✅ Use descriptive commit messages
- ✅ Update relevant documentation
- ✅ Consider security implications

## Workflow Variations

### Quick Exploration

For smaller tasks, combine explore and plan:

```
Examine the shopping cart component and plan how to add a "save for later" feature
```

### Deep Dive Exploration

For complex systems, spend more time exploring:

```
Please thoroughly analyze the entire e-commerce system architecture. 
Read the main components, understand the data flow, and identify 
the key integration points. This is for a major refactoring project.
```

### Iterative Planning

For large features, plan in phases:

```
Create a high-level plan for the user notification system. 
We'll implement it in multiple sprints, so focus on the overall architecture 
and major milestones.
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Bug Fixes

**Explore**: Understand the bug and affected code
**Plan**: Identify root cause and fix strategy  
**Code**: Implement fix with tests
**Commit**: Document the fix

### 2. New Features

**Explore**: Understand existing architecture
**Plan**: Design feature integration
**Code**: Implement incrementally
**Commit**: Add feature with documentation

### 3. Refactoring

**Explore**: Analyze current implementation
**Plan**: Design improved architecture
**Code**: Refactor step by step
**Commit**: Document improvements

### 4. Integration

**Explore**: Understand both systems
**Plan**: Design integration approach
**Code**: Implement with error handling
**Commit**: Document integration

## Tips for Success

### Exploration Tips

- Start broad, then narrow focus
- Don't rush to coding
- Ask Claude to explain complex parts
- Identify patterns and conventions

### Planning Tips

- Break down into small steps
- Consider dependencies and order
- Plan for testing and validation
- Include rollback strategies

### Coding Tips

- Follow the plan but adapt as needed
- Test each piece individually
- Maintain code quality standards
- Ask for reviews and improvements

### Commit Tips

- Ensure everything works
- Write clear commit messages
- Update documentation
- Consider deployment implications
