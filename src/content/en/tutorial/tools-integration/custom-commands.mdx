# Custom Commands

Custom commands allow you to create shortcuts and automation for frequently used workflows in Claude Code.

## What are Custom Commands?

Custom commands are:
- **Shortcuts**: Quick access to complex operations
- **Automation**: Streamlined repetitive tasks
- **Templates**: Reusable instruction patterns
- **Workflows**: Multi-step process automation

## Types of Custom Commands

### 1. Slash Commands

Quick shortcuts that start with `/`:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/deploy.md
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy application to staging environment
---

Please perform a production-ready deployment:
1. Run all tests and ensure they pass
2. Build the application for production
3. Run security checks and linting
4. Deploy to staging environment
5. Verify deployment health checks
6. Provide deployment summary
```

Usage:
```
/deploy
```

### 2. Workflow Commands

Multi-step automation sequences:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/feature.md
---
name: feature
description: Start new feature development
parameters:
  - name: feature_name
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: branch_prefix
    type: string
    default: "feature"
---

Create a new feature branch and setup:
1. Create branch: {{branch_prefix}}/{{feature_name}}
2. Update local dependencies
3. Create basic component structure in src/components/{{feature_name}}/
4. Add feature to main navigation
5. Create initial test file
6. Update documentation with feature overview
```

Usage:
```
/feature user-dashboard
/feature payment-system --branch_prefix=enhancement
```

### 3. Analysis Commands

Code analysis and reporting shortcuts:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/analyze.md
---
name: analyze
description: Comprehensive codebase analysis
---

Perform a comprehensive analysis of the current codebase:
1. Analyze project structure and architecture
2. Identify potential performance bottlenecks
3. Check for code duplication and refactoring opportunities
4. Review security considerations
5. Assess test coverage
6. Generate improvement recommendations
```

## Creating Custom Commands

### Command File Structure

```
.claude/
├── commands/
│   ├── deploy.md
│   ├── feature.md
│   ├── analyze.md
│   └── refactor.md
└── templates/
    ├── component.md
    └── api.md
```

### Command Metadata

```markdown
---
name: command_name
description: Brief description of what the command does
parameters:
  - name: param1
    type: string|number|boolean
    required: true|false
    default: default_value
    description: Parameter description
tags:
  - development
  - testing
  - deployment
---

Command instructions here...
```

### Parameter Usage

```markdown
# Using parameters in commands
Please create a {{component_type}} component named {{component_name}}:
1. Create file: src/components/{{component_name}}/{{component_name}}.tsx
2. Include {{features}} if specified
3. Add to index.ts with {{export_type}} export
```

## Advanced Command Features

### 1. Conditional Logic

```markdown
# .claude/commands/setup.md
---
name: setup
parameters:
  - name: environment
    type: string
    default: "development"
  - name: with_database
    type: boolean
    default: false
---

Setup {{environment}} environment:

{% if environment == "production" %}
1. Verify production credentials
2. Run security audit
3. Enable monitoring
{% else %}
1. Setup development database
2. Install dev dependencies
3. Configure debug mode
{% endif %}

{% if with_database %}
4. Initialize database schema
5. Run migrations
6. Seed test data
{% endif %}
```

### 2. Template Inheritance

```markdown
# .claude/templates/base-component.md
---
template: true
---

Create a React component with:
1. TypeScript interface
2. Proper prop validation
3. Accessibility attributes
4. Unit tests
5. Storybook stories

# .claude/commands/ui-component.md
---
extends: base-component
name: ui-component
---

{% include "base-component" %}

Additionally for UI components:
6. Design system integration
7. Responsive design
8. Theme support
```

### 3. Command Composition

```markdown
# .claude/commands/full-feature.md
---
name: full-feature
description: Complete feature development workflow
---

Execute the complete feature development workflow:

1. {% command "feature" feature_name %}
2. {% command "test" type="unit" %}
3. {% command "analyze" focus="security" %}
4. {% command "deploy" environment="staging" %}
```

## Configuration

### Global Commands

```json
// .claude/config.json
{
  "commands": {
    "globalPath": "~/.claude/global-commands",
    "autoload": true,
    "aliases": {
      "d": "deploy",
      "f": "feature",
      "a": "analyze"
    }
  }
}
```

### Project-Specific Commands

```json
// .claude/project.json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "commands": {
    "path": ".claude/commands",
    "enabled": [
      "deploy",
      "feature",
      "analyze"
    ],
    "disabled": [
      "production-deploy"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Command Design

**Keep Commands Focused**
- Single responsibility principle
- Clear, specific outcomes
- Minimal parameter complexity

**Use Descriptive Names**
```markdown
# Good
/deploy-staging
/create-api-endpoint
/run-security-audit

# Avoid
/do-stuff
/fix
/update
```

### 2. Parameter Validation

```markdown
---
parameters:
  - name: component_name
    type: string
    required: true
    pattern: "^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$"
    description: "PascalCase component name"
  - name: port
    type: number
    min: 1000
    max: 9999
    default: 3000
---
```

### 3. Documentation

```markdown
# .claude/commands/deploy.md
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy application with comprehensive checks
examples:
  - "/deploy"
  - "/deploy --environment=production"
  - "/deploy --skip-tests=true"
---

## What this command does:
- Runs complete test suite
- Builds optimized production bundle
- Performs security scanning
- Deploys to specified environment
- Verifies deployment health

## Prerequisites:
- Clean git working directory
- Valid deployment credentials
- All tests passing locally
```
