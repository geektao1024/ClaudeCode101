# Git Version Control

Claude Code integrates seamlessly with Git, enabling intelligent version control workflows that enhance your development process.

## Basic Git Operations

### Intelligent Commits

Claude can analyze your changes and create meaningful commit messages:

```
Analyze the current changes and create an appropriate commit message
```

Claude will:
- Review staged and unstaged changes
- Understand the context of modifications
- Generate descriptive commit messages following best practices
- Suggest breaking large changes into smaller commits

### Branch Management

**Creating Feature Branches**:
```
Create a new feature branch for implementing user authentication
```

**Branch Switching**:
```
Switch to the development branch and show me the recent changes
```

**Merge Conflict Resolution**:
```
Help me resolve the merge conflicts in src/components/Header.tsx
```

## Advanced Workflows

### Code Review Preparation

Before creating pull requests:

```
Review my changes and prepare them for a pull request:
1. Check code quality
2. Ensure tests are included
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Suggest commit message improvements
```

### Release Management

**Version Bumping**:
```
Prepare for a new release:
1. Update version numbers
2. Generate changelog
3. Tag the release
4. Update documentation
```

**Hotfix Workflow**:
```
Create a hotfix branch for the critical bug in user authentication
```

### Git Hooks Integration

Claude can help set up and maintain Git hooks:

```
Set up pre-commit hooks that:
1. Run linting
2. Execute tests
3. Check code formatting
4. Validate commit messages
```

## Best Practices

### Commit Message Standards

Claude follows conventional commit standards:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### Branch Naming

Claude suggests meaningful branch names:
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `bugfix/login-validation`
- `hotfix/security-patch`
- `docs/api-reference`

### Code Review Guidelines

**Before Requesting Review**:
```
Prepare this code for review:
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Check code coverage
3. Verify documentation is updated
4. Confirm no debugging code remains
```

**Addressing Review Comments**:
```
Address the review comments in the pull request and update the code accordingly
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Continuous Integration

Claude can help set up CI/CD pipelines:

```
Create a GitHub Actions workflow that:
1. Runs tests on every push
2. Builds the application
3. Deploys to staging on main branch
4. Creates release on tags
```

### Quality Gates

```
Set up quality gates that prevent merging if:
1. Tests are failing
2. Code coverage drops below 80%
3. Linting errors exist
4. Security vulnerabilities are detected
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Git Issues

**Merge Conflicts**:
```
I have merge conflicts in multiple files. Help me resolve them systematically.
```

**Accidental Commits**:
```
I accidentally committed sensitive information. Help me remove it from history.
```

**Branch Synchronization**:
```
My feature branch is behind main. Help me safely update it.
```

### Recovery Operations

**Lost Changes**:
```
I lost some changes after a hard reset. Can you help me recover them?
```

**Corrupted Repository**:
```
My repository seems corrupted. Help me diagnose and fix the issues.
```

## Team Collaboration

### Pull Request Templates

Claude can create standardized PR templates:

```
Create a pull request template that includes:
1. Description of changes
2. Testing checklist
3. Documentation updates
4. Breaking changes notice
```

### Code Review Automation

```
Set up automated code review that checks:
1. Code style consistency
2. Security best practices
3. Performance implications
4. Test coverage requirements
```

By integrating Claude Code with your Git workflow, you can maintain high code quality while streamlining your development process.
